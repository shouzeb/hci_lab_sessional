A modern hotel has installed a sandwich making robot to supply room service sandwiches at 24/7 hour of the day. The hotel  has an automated delivery and billing system that will take the completed sandwich to a specified room and after delivery receive the bill.
 You have been asked to program a software agent interface that customer/guest can place order through phone call for sandwiches.

 Short scenario describing how a customer/guest would order a sandwich using your interface:
      
          Alice gets into her hotel room late and is hungry. She wants to order room service, so she opens up the guest book and sees that she can order one of three sandwiches from the menu at any time of night. So she dials the number in the guest book, a recording answers asking her to type  the number of the sandwich she wants. The guest book has a number code next to each sandwich so Alice type 23 through the phone key pad to order a ham sandwich. She is then told to confirm that she wants a ham sandwich by pressing 1. She does so and is informed that her sandwich will arrive in 10 minutes. After waiting 10 minutes she gets a knock at her door and a robotic trolly has her sandwich. 

A hierarchical task description of the sandwich ordering process is given below. 

 The following answer has several choice points which are possible. To begin with the person may choose to find the phone number, and perhaps dial it before trying to select a sandwich.

 (c) Convey sandwich selection to the system 
         i. Dial the phone number 
         ii. Listen to the recorded message about sandwich delivery 
       iii. Be asked to relay the sandwich number 
        iv. Find the number next to the selected sandwich 
        v. Type in the number code
 (d) Confirm selection
